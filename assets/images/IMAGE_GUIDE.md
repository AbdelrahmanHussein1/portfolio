## Image Optimization

Before uploading profile and about images:

1. Resize to recommended dimensions
2. Compress with tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
3. Convert to WebP format for better performance
4. Keep file size under 200KB per image

## Quick Setup (For immediate testing)

You can temporarily update the `index.html` file to use online placeholders for profile and about images:

Replace image `src` attributes with:

- Profile: `https://via.placeholder.com/400x400/00d4ff/ffffff?text=Profile`
- About: `https://via.placeholder.com/600x800/1a1a2e/00d4ff?text=About`

This will allow you to test the website immediately while you prepare your actual images.
